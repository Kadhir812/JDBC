# Railway Reservation System - JDBC

This is a Railway Ticket Reservation System built using Java and JDBC. The system allows users to book tickets, view existing reservations, and interact with a database to store and retrieve ticket data.

## Features

- **Book a Ticket**: Enter passenger name, train number, seat number, and journey date to book a ticket.
- **View Tickets**: View all booked tickets with passenger details.
- **Database Integration**: Interacts with MySQL database to store and retrieve reservations.

## Prerequisites

- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- MySQL database
- JDBC driver for MySQL (ensure MySQL connector is added to your project)

## Setup

1. **Install MySQL**:
   If MySQL is not already installed, download it from [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

2. **Create Database**:
   Create a database and table to store reservation data by running the following SQL commands in MySQL:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE RailwayReservation;
   USE RailwayReservation;

   CREATE TABLE tickets (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       passenger_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       train_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       seat_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       journey_date DATE NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   Update the database connection settings in your code. You’ll need to modify the database URL, username, and password to match your environment.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Compile and run the `ReservationSystem.java` file.
   - The GUI will open, where you can book tickets or view existing reservations.

## Code Structure

- **ReservationSystem.java**: The main GUI class handling user input for booking and viewing tickets.
- **JDBC Database Connection**: Manages the interaction with the MySQL database to store ticket information.

### Fields in the System:

- **Passenger Name**: Text field for entering the passenger’s name.
- **Train Number**: Text field for entering the train number.
- **Seat Number**: Text field for entering the seat number.
- **Journey Date**: Text field for entering the journey date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
